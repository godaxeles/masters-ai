## AI-Generated Variants

| # | Image | Prompt Snippet | Settings |
|---|-------|----------------|----------|
| 1 | ![v1](data/generated/variant-1.png) | "masterpiece album cover art, [genre] style..." | 30 steps, CFG 7.5, seed 42 |
| 2 | ![v2](data/generated/variant-2.png) | "vintage vinyl cover design, [theme]..." | 30 steps, CFG 7.5, seed 123 |
| 3 | ![v3](data/generated/variant-3.png) | "modern minimalist cover, [mood]..." | 30 steps, CFG 7.5, seed 456 |

## Workflow Details

### 1. Model & Checkpoint
- **Primary Model**: Stable Diffusion XL Base 1.0
- **HuggingFace Hub**: https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0
- **Fallback Model**: Stable Diffusion v1.5 for compatibility

### 2. Adapters & Extensions
- None (using base models only)
- Future: Consider LoRA adapters for style consistency

### 3. Generation Settings
- **Inference Steps**: 30 (balanced quality/speed)
- **Sampler**: Euler Ancestral Discrete
- **Guidance Scale**: 7.5 (moderate prompt adherence)
- **Resolution**: 1024x1024 (SDXL native)
- **Precision**: FP32 (MPS compatibility)

### 4. Pipeline Configuration

### 6. Technical Resources
- **Framework**: ðŸ¤— Diffusers v0.33.0+
- **Backend**: PyTorch 2.0+ with MPS support
- **Hardware**: Apple Silicon Mac with 16+ GB RAM
- **Generation Time**: ~45-60 seconds per image (1024x1024)
- **Model Size**: ~6.8 GB (SDXL Base)

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Generation Time | 45-60s | Per 1024x1024 image, 30 steps |
| Memory Usage | ~8-12 GB | With attention slicing |
| Model Load Time | ~30s | First load, cached afterward |
| Quality Score | 8.5/10 | Subjective assessment |

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Memory Management
